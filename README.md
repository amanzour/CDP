# CDP
The program intersects RNAseq (WT & KD) and PAR-CLIP data and creates Cummulative Distribution Plots for mRNA differential expression. Genes are categorized to targets and non-targets. The degree to which each gene might be a target depends on abundance of cross-linked reads on its mRNA (PAR-CLIP) in the context of its expression (WT RNA-seq).

This project is under construction.
Input file is a tab-delimited table with specific columns, to be added. I'm currently completing the Shiny app that imports bam files and produces the needed table for CDP.
Please email me if you want to try it on your own data amir.manzour@gmail.com
